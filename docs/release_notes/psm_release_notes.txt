              Open Fabrics Enterprise Distribution (OFED)
                    PSM in OFED 3.5 Release Notes

                          December 2012

======================================================================
1. Overview
======================================================================

The Performance Scaled Messaging (PSM) API is Intel's low-level user-level
communications interface for the Intel(R) True Scale Fabric family of products.

The PSM libraries are included in the infinipath-psm-3.1-364.1140_open.src.rpm
source RPM and get built and installed as part of a default OFED
install process.

The primary way to use PSM is by compiling applications with an MPI that has
been built to use the PSM layer as its interface to Intel HCAs.
PSM is the high-performance interface to the Intel(R) True Scale HCAs.

Minimal instructions* for building two MPIs tested with OFED 
with PSM support are as follows:


Open MPI:

- Download a recent Open MPI tar ball from 
   http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.6/ .
  Versions 1.6.1 & 1.6.3 has been tested with PSM from this OFED release.
- Untar the file and cd to the Open MPI directory.  Then
  ./configure --with-psm --prefix=<install directory>
  make
  make install

MVAPICH2:

- Download a recent MVAPICH2 tar ball from
   http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/download/mvapich2/
  Version 1.8.1 has been tested with PSM from this OFED release.
- Untar the file and go to the mvapich2-1.x.x directory
- Execute the configure and make commands as follows:
  ./configure --prefix=<install directory> --with-device=ch3:psm \
   --enable-shared
  make
  make install



* To configure with a different compiler suite than the native GCC suite on your
  Linux machine, set the configure or script variables: CC, CXX, F77, F90 to be
  assigned to the appropriate compiler names for your suite, such as for the 
  Intel Compiler suite:
  CC=icc
  CXX=icpc
  F77=ifort
  F90=ifort
